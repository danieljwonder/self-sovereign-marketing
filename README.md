## Purpose

Self-Sovereign Marketing is a framework for building direct, durable, consent-based relationships that survive beyond any single platform.  
The manifesto in this repo defines the core axiom, four pillars, and values that guide the practice.

This repository provides:

- A versioned history of changes  
- A place for proposals, translations, and clarity fixes  
- A forkable base for anyone who wants to adapt or extend the idea  

The text is free, open, and remixable.
